# GlidrU – Concise Background & Vision

*Last updated 22 Jul 2025*

---

## 1 Mission

Build the first **AI-augmented college-selection platform** that helps high-school student-athletes—initially for **soccer, volleyball, baseball/softball, lacrosse, and golf**—discover, evaluate, and shortlist universities that truly fit their athletic, academic, and financial goals.

---

## 2 Core Value Proposition

1. **Curated search space** – Tailors \~4 000 US colleges down to a relevant subset per user (sport, division, program, geography, budget, climate, etc.).
2. **GenAI-powered research** – Sends large-scale, batched LLM prompts to gather “hard-to-scrape” details (coach philosophy, walk-on culture, program ethos) and cleans/normalizes the raw answers.
3. **Data-driven recommendations** – Applies an ML recommendation engine (“Glidr Path Score”) that weighs user preferences against institutional & program attributes.

## 3 Two-Phase User Flow

| Phase                         | What the user sees                                                | Back-end work                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Tailor My List**         | Filters, sliders, preference-weighting UI                         | Pull IPEDS + sports-program tables → narrow the catalog        |
| **2. Deep Insights & Advice** | LLM-derived answers, analytics dashboards, rank-ordered shortlist | GenAI batch prompts, embeddings, ML scoring, explanation layer |

## 4 Data-Source Strategy

| Tier                | Source                                              | License stance                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Canonical facts** | IPEDS, College Scorecard (US gov)                   | Public-domain → can be stored & monetized |
| **Sports programs** | Wikidata (CC0) + light NCAA/conference scraping     | Free, but avoid trademarks/logos          |
| **Hard insights**   | GenAI prompting, program websites, coach interviews | Proprietary value-add generated by GlidrU |

> *A dedicated **glidrU_IPEDS_ingestion_pipeline** repo ingests the once-a-year IPEDS MDB (provisional + final) and loads versioned tables into BigQuery. All parameters live in `config.ini`; secrets load from `.env`.*

## 5 Tech & Architecture North-Star

| Layer               | Key choices                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Front-end**       | React / Next.js (`glidru-web`)                                                                                                        |
| **APIs & Services** | FastAPI on GKE or Cloud Run (`glidru-services`)                                                                                       |
| **AI & ML**         | GenAI batch worker (`glidru-genai-crawl`) – Python container<br>Recommendation API (`glidru-ml-reco`) – PyTorch, GPU-enabled          |
| **Data**            | BigQuery warehouse; feature store optional                                                                                            |
| **Pipelines**       | Stand-alone container jobs for rare ingests (e.g., IPEDS) → later pluggable into Airflow/Prefect                                      |
| **Dev-Ex**          | Poetry for deps, Black for formatting, Cookiecutter for scaffolding; Docker for everything; GHCR for images; GitHub Actions for CI/CD |

> **Coding principles** – single-responsibility components, no monolithic scripts, all configurable via `config.ini`; secrets only in `.env`.
